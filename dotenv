# The .env file is used to store environment variables, which are values that can be
# used by multiple applications or processes. They are typically used to store configuration
# information, such as database passwords or API keys, that need to be kept secret and out of
# version control.
#
# Using a .env file allows you to store these sensitive values in a separate file that can
# be excluded from version control (see .gitignore) and easily shared with other developers or
# deployments. When the application or process is run, the .env file is loaded and the values
# stored in it are made available to the application as environment variables.
#
# This is a useful way to manage configuration information, as it allows you to easily switch
# between different configurations (e.g., development, staging, production) by simply changing
# the values in the .env file. It also makes it easy to share configurations with other
# developers or deployments, as you can simply share the .env file rather than hardcoding the
# values into the application itself.
